There are enhancements that may be added in the future to polish out the
animations and maybe add new features that go beyond what ansimuz's series goes
to. All non-commercial and experimental learning changes. 

- Pause screen
- Controls screen at the beginning of the game
- Bullet types
- More enemy animations
- Lives 
- Ship types
- Ship upgrades

All of this will serve as a learning experience of the bottom rung of game
design/programming.
