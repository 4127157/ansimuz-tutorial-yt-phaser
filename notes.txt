- Scenes can be for anything

- There can be multipe scenes running in the same game simultaneously

- A title screen for a game, for example, could be a scene. As could be a menu
  and other things such as that

- It is easy to imagine as one scene for the menu, one for the game and one for
  the map

- Scenes can all communicate between each other while having their other
  concerns separated

- Each scene can have its own file, making code easier to manage

- Scenes follow the standard practice of 4 optional functions - init, preload,
  create and update (looper function)

- In the configuration, scenes must be specified in an array to the `scene` key

- `this.scene.start(Str)` is how another scene is started from an existing one
